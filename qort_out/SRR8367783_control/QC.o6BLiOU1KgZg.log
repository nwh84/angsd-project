NOTE: Unmatched Read Buffer Size > 100000 [Mem usage:[3301MB / 3959MB]]
    (This is generally not a problem, but if this increases further then OutOfMemoryExceptions
    may occur.
    If memory errors do occur, either increase memory allocation or sort the bam-file by name
    and rerun with the '--nameSorted' option.
    This might also indicate that your dataset contains an unusually large number of
    chimeric read-pairs. Or it could occur simply due to the presence of genomic
    loci with extremly high coverage. It may also indicate a SAM/BAM file that 
    does not adhere to the standard SAM specification.)

WARNING: QoRTs is unable to infer the strandedness from the data!
         This isn't a problem per-se, since QoRTs requires that strandedness
         mode be set manually. However, it might be indicative that something
         is very wrong with your dataset and/or transcript annotation.
QoRTs completed WITH WARNINGS! See log for details.
