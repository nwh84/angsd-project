# Note: if this file EXISTS, then QoRTs QC completed WITH WARNINGS. Warning messages follow:
Warning: run-in-progress file "/athena/angsd/scratch/naw4005/qort_out/SRR8368044_BP1//QC.QORTS_RUNNING" already exists. Is there another QoRTs job running?
WARNING: QoRTs is unable to infer the strandedness from the data!
         This isn't a problem per-se, since QoRTs requires that strandedness
         mode be set manually. However, it might be indicative that something
         is very wrong with your dataset and/or transcript annotation.
QoRTs completed WITH WARNINGS! See log for details.
